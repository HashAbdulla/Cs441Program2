# Program 2 by Hashim Abdulla

## Quick summary

The development of this recursive descent, top-down parser for a simple calculator language involved multiple iterations, debugging cycles, and optimizations. The goal was to implement a parser that follows a structured grammar and correctly processes input files containing 
  arithmetic and logical expressions. The parser ultimately follows a well-defined grammar and successfully builds parse trees. Mostly generated by Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
